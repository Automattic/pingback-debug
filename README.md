# Pingback debug

This WordPress plugin is meant to help you to track down the reasons why outgoing pingbacks are failing.

Any failed pingback action gets recored to appropriate post's meta. The key consits of the `_pingback_debug_` prefix and a md5 value of the URL which was unable to accept the ping.
